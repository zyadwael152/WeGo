1. Branching

Do not push directly to main (unless instructed).

Create feature branches:

feature/api-wikipedia
feature/styling
etc.

Or test the current task you are doing. 

2. Commits

Keep commits small and clear.

Use descriptive messages:

style: improve card UI

🎯 Team Notes

This repo is for coordinated development between all six members.
